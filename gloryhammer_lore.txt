Yeah, oh!
Riding 'cross the terror-zone
With the blaster in his hand
An unholy quest to break the tomb
Of the frozen wizard
Slashing through the brotherhood
The pathetic knights of Crail
Now the secrets of the gods are mine
They will yield to me, yeah
Far away inside the ancient citadel of Crail
(I know a goblin waits for me)
Through the gates now strewn
With blood and guts and bits of brain
(I know a goblin waits for me)
(Dark wizard, Angus comes for thee)
Heroes of the wasteland
Prepare for final fight
The nuclear clone of Zargothrax
Cannot escape this night
He wields the laser blaster
Our quest may yet be doomed
Unless we seek the robot prince
Of mighty Auchtertool
With eyes ablaze with crimson fire
And great boronic wings
His armor wrought from powersteel
Heir of the mecha-king
Heroes charge with vengeance
Unicorns are in pursuit
But with the power of robot might
They'll answer now to Hoots
Robot prince of Auchtertool
Over thy robot kingdom rule
Electronic lord of war
Destined to reign forever more
Robot prince of Auchtertool
Over thy robot kingdom rule
Electronic lord of war
Destined to reign forever more
Back inside the citadel
The containment zone ahead
Override the cryogenic seals
Demonic power
No one left to stop me now
My progenitor arise
Now the land of Fife will kneel before
Mighty double wizard
Zargothrax
Warning, containment seals breached
Cryogenic stasis system overload
Liquid ice prison failure imminent
Warning, warning, warning
Double! Wizard!
Sorcerus geminus
Diabolica duplicatus
Sorcerus geminus
Diabolica ultimae
After decades of torment
Dark fortune smiles my way
My progeny hath served me well
His reward shall be death's citadel
Now, with the knife and the blaster
We'll conjoin ourselves at the brain
Powerless prince of Fife
We'll now take your life
Let you and your kin burn in hell
Sorcerus geminus
Diabolica duplicatus
Sorcerus geminus
Diabolica ultimae
At last, by the machinations of my clone (Dundee, Dundee!)
I am free from the shackles of frozen slumber (robot!)
After countless aeons of scheming across multiple dimensions (viator!)
The grand cosmic plan of Zargothrax will now come to fruition (Dundee, vortex!)
The chronological imperative will be eradicated (noctem!)
By the power of two wizards you shall perish (iudicium!)
Slaves of the armies of Angus
Warriors who yearn to be free
I will liberate you from the chains of your life
Your souls now belong to me
Rise as a creature of darkness
Rise as an undead machine
In the name of the sorcerer Zargothrax
Vanquish the paleocene, yeah
And lo, the time for reckoning is at hand
Prince Angus, your reign ends today
Prepare to die
Begone, foul servants of chaos
I swear by the blood of the sword in my veins
I will never be defeat
For the eternal glory of Dundee
Robot prince of Auchtertool
Over thy robot kingdom rule
Electronic lord of war
Destined to reign forever more
Knife of evil is too great
Prince of the robots meets his fate
Auchtertool no longer fight
Killed by the wizard lord this night
Now the ultimate battle begins
Angus is fighting the sorcerous twins
There is no chance for our hero to win
Wielding the hammer of glory so high
Knife made of evil make threaten to die
Dark laser blaster shoot death in the sky
Suddenly the heavens cry
Behold, creatures of Earth
By your foolish meddling with the three artifacts of power
You have summoned forth the starlords of eternity
These weapons are not your playthings to be trifled with
And so for your impudent acts, your world shall be eradicated
Except for you, brave prince, join us
For your destiny awaits beyond the outer reaches of the galaxy
The hammer, the knife and the blaster collide
Starlords of heaven return from the skies
Making the wizards and warriors die
Only prince Angus is spared from this doom
Starlords beseech him to quest to the moon
They have revealed him a new destiny
Far across the endless galaxy
By the holy flaming hammer of unholy cosmic frost
I will voyage 'cross the multiverse to fight for what was lost
From this realm of nuclear chaos, to a world beyond the stars
I will quest forever onwards, so far
I will wield the holy hammer of flame
Unholy cosmic frost (ecce princeps Dundonensis)
(Imperator ascendit in astra eterna)
